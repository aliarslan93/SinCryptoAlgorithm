# ðŸ“ˆ Sine Wave Visualizer
Bitcoin and other Crypto Currencies In the sine wave, the repeating structures of 1=3 each represent the characters you mentioned above.
This project visualizes sine waves using Python. With the help of matplotlib and numpy, it provides a clear and enhanced graph representation.

# ðŸš€ Requirements

# ðŸ”§ What's Changed?
The sine wave now displays 6 full cycles (previously it was 2).

Intersection points are automatically extended: Ï€, 2Ï€, ..., 11Ï€.

The graph width is increased to accommodate more wave cycles.
