# 📈 Sine Wave Visualizer

Bitcoin and other Crypto Currencies  
In the sine wave, the repeating structures of 1=3 each represent the characters you mentioned above.  
This project visualizes sine waves using Python. With the help of `matplotlib` and `numpy`, it provides a clear and enhanced graph representation.

## 🚀 Requirements

- Python  
- Libraries:  
  ```bash
  <br/>
<code>  pip install matplotlib numpy</code>
<br/>
<code>nginx</code>
## 🔧 What's Changed?
The sine wave now displays 6 full cycles (previously it was 2).

Intersection points are automatically extended: π, 2π, ..., 11π.

The graph width is increased to accommodate more wave cycles.

## ⚠️ Note
This project is for godless companies and their workers.
You can download the project to index.html and start the sine game.
